# HI, I AM SHRAVAN 👋

I work on **observability engineering for production-scale distributed systems**, helping teams understand system behavior through metrics, logs, and traces. My focus is on improving **reliability, visibility, and cost-efficiency** of observability platforms.

Alongside my professional work, I’m deeply interested in **AI forensics and digital investigation** — exploring how intelligent systems fail, how telemetry can act as evidence, and how forensic thinking can improve trust and accountability in modern software.

## 🔍 What I Do

### Observability & Platform Engineering
- Scaled **Observability SDK adoption across 100+ applications**, enabling structured logging, metrics, and distributed tracing
- Deployed **Jaeger in production**, driving ** observability cost reduction**
- Migrated observability platforms (**Honeycomb → Jaeger**, **Datadog → Prometheus + Grafana**)
- Built **observability scorecards** to track adoption and maturity across services
- Developed **parity audit tools** to validate migrations and enable data-driven cost optimization
- Designed dashboards and alerts for **BOSH storage workloads**
- Supported production incidents, tool upgrades, and observability governance

## 🧪 Projects

### **Artificer — Prompt-Driven Text-to-3D Framework**
- Built a diffusion-based **text-to-3D generation pipeline** using PyTorch and NLP
- Improved model fidelity by **46%** compared to baseline approaches
- Reduced training time by **43%** through NeRF optimizations
- Enhanced semantic accuracy using **LLMs (LLaMA 2)** for complex prompt understanding
